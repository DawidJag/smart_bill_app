# smart_bill_app
This is my first application written in Python from scratch. Actually, this is my first programming project at all. Thus, graphical interface is rather simple as I was learning Kivy module during writing this code. I am still working on development of this app.

Application for settlements of bills between few people. You can use it to split/settle bills during for example holiday's journey with your friends/family. It allows you to collect many bills for one settlement and at the end display final reports with payments that should be made between participants. You can also save this report in PDF file.
